Hi there!

I am a 4th year Ph.D. canidate at MIT Sloan in the Information Technologies (IT) group - a subgroup of the Management Science program - where I am advised by Erik Brynjolfsson. My research interests center on the effects of technology on society - specifically, the effects of automation on labor market outcomes and the acquisition of skills and human capital. 

In 2018 I was a Data Science Intern in LinkedInâ€™s Economic Graph team and in an ongoing project with them I study how career paths and labor mobility have changed over time.

Before joining MIT in 2016 I was a Research Assistant for two years for Susan Athey and Markus Mobius at the Microsoft Research New England Lab and worked on several projects, including one on the [Impact of News Aggregators on Internet News Consumption](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/impact-news-aggregators-internet-news-consumption-case-localization) and the [Indonesian Celebrity Immunization Twitter Experiment](https://economics.mit.edu/files/16501) among others.
